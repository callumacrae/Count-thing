"If you write out the first 500,000,000 positive integers, youâ€™ll write the figure 1 exactly 500,000,000 times."

This project is an attempt to prove that fact unremarkable. There are many other numbers like this, and it is also possible to use numbers but 1.

This is my first C project, so progress WILL be slow :D
